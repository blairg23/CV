# Summary (my current wording)

Full-stack software engineer & technical product strategist focused on **automation, data infrastructure, and cloud-native backends**. Last 5 years: shipped healthcare & education platforms, led DevOps for high-throughput releases, and integrated AWS-centric systems. Bias toward reducing toil, surfacing signal, and shipping value.
